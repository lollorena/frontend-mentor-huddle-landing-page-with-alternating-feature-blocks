## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- BEM

### What I learned

I've learned CSS architecture (BEM):

```html
  <header class="header">
   <div class="header__image-logo">
    <img src="src/img/logo-1.svg" alt="huddle">
   </div>

   <nav class="menu">
    <ul>
     <a href="#" class="menu__item">
      <li>Try it Free</li>
     </a>
    </ul>
   </nav>
  </header>
```

### Continued development

I'll continue to improve my CSS skills, especially flexbox, grid and responsive design. And from now on, I'll build websites using BEM.

### Useful resources

- [BEM by Examples](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/bem_by_example) - This resource helped me to apply BEM to my code
- [BEM documentation](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - It was helpful for me to understand more about blocks/components
